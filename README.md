C-Data-Structures
=================

A library of data structures in C created in an attempt to further my knowledge of data structures. Still under construction!

Using the library is simple, #include "pgdatastructures.h" near the top of your main file. All functions and type definitions have the prefix "pg" added to them. You should avoid using functions prefixed by "pg" in your program.
